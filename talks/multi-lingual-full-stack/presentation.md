# Outline

what it means to be a multi-lingual or full-stack developer, including pros/cons, based on my experience and observations. The intent would be to give some insight to your students about why they may want to follow different paths. I'd also want to push back against some of the snobbishness and Tribalism that is sometimes a result of a narrow attachment to a particular language.

Examples of re-use:

- XPath match -> SQL -> map/select -> Linq
- Haskell Quickcheck -> other langs

Possible downsides:

- C# yields != Python generators

Notes:

# Who

me: Made a career out of not wanting to pigeon-hole myself. AI & CS -> Two Startups -> Research Assitant -> Three big companies

---

# What

XPath / SQL / Linq /
Ruby / Python

"knowing the layout of the room"

---

# Why

Spotting and re-using Patterns
Perspective "Everything is shit"
Bootstrap Value
Problem-focussed
Choosing the right language for the job
Robust company

---

# How

Trying experiments / characterising options
Pigeon-hole test: power + culture
When to exit / feeling the grain ("this would be easier / better in Language X / Layer Y")
Being a librarian / router

---

# Why Not

Never the "best" at anything
Hard for other people to understand what you do: you are the Elephant
Can be easy to get distracted by options

---

# Closing

This is an option for a way to work, not a requirement. Being a specialist is still totally fine.
Please be proficient in at least two languages. 1 is very different to 2 . "avoid being a Java programmer". Drop your prejudices (something I still struggle with)
